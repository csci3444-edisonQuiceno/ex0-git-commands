Example project to show using git commands at command line

## Make sure git is installed
git --version

## First see and set, git config settings
### To see all git config settings
git config --list

### To see specific global git config setting like user.name , user.email
git config --global user.name <br>

</pre>

### if below is true , then git commit will do conversion(from windows to unix) of line endings of file being committed. If false it will not. In windows machine it is suggested to be set to true. In Mac false.
git config --global core.autocrlf  <br>
git config core.autocrlf

### you can set it to true globally as
git config --global core.autocrlf true

## Create a project dir
<pre>
mkdir -p /c/fdu/csci3444/projects/ex0_git_commands
cd /c/fdu/csci3444/projects/ex0_git_commands
ls -a
</pre>
## Create local git repo at the project's home directory
git init   <br>
ls -a

## Create some files and dir
<pre>
touch index.html
touch style.css
touch script.js
touch README.md
touch letGitIgnoreMe.txt
mkdir target
touch target/someDumFile.txt
</pre>

## see what git thinks about these files and dir (NOTE git sees all files and dirs as "Untracked files" displayed in red)
git status

## Create .gitignore file with below contents
```sh
# files to be ignored by git #
##############################
letGitIgnoreMe.txt

# directories to be ignored by git #
####################################
/target/

# local git repo to be ignored by git as well #
###############################################
.git/
```
## To add a file from "working"(normal) dir to git's staging(index)
git add README.md

## To undo (remove) adding a file to git's staging(index)
git rm --cached README.md

## To add all files from working dir to staging
git add .

## To commit staged files to local repository
git commit -m 'initial commit' README.md

## To re-add to staging and commit to local repo in 1 step of ALL files that were added to staging before they were modified again
<pre>
echo 'deleteMe' >> README.md
unix2dos README.txt
git commit -a -m 'commit after dummy edit'
</pre>

## To see difference between working tree and staging(index)
git diff

## To see difference between staging(index) and (local)repo
git diff --cached

## To see difference between working tree and repo
git diff HEAD

## To create branch
git branch hello

## To switch to a branch
git checkout hello     <br>
git checkout masterOA

## To see branches and the active one (the one with * next to it)
git branch

## To see all(local and remote tracking) branches and the active one (the one with * next to it)
git branch -a

## To create a branch and switch to that branch together
git checkout -b fix123Branch

## Make some changes in branch and commit them to branch
<pre>
echo 'h1 { color:red;}' >> style.css; unix2dos style.css
git add style.css
git commit -m 'added h1 element style' style.css
</pre>

## To switch to master branch and merge changes from another branch to master
git checkout master <br>
git merge fix123Branch

## To delete branch
git branch -d fix123Branch

## To create a tag ( a light weight tag)
git tag V0.1 

## To create annotated tag ( a heavy weight tag, that is in the graph, that stores by who and when tag happened)
git tag -a -m 'v0.1 release' V0.1 

## NOTE light weight tag is like book marker, heavy weight tag is like marking book with a highlighter

## To see list of tags
git tag   <br>
git tag -l

## To switch to a tag
git checkout V0.1

## To delete tag
git tag -d v0.1.1

## To delete remote tag
git push origin -d v0.1.1

## To see commits on current branch (master)
git log

## To see commits in a remote's(like remote origin, or remote paul) branch
<pre>
git log origin/master
git log paul/master
git log paul/remoteBranch
</pre>

## To see remote repository settings
git remote -v

## To set remote repository to a github repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/fdu-csci3444/ex0-git-commands.git

## To push to remote repo (NOTE -u is --set-upstream , which sets current branch as the remote tracking branch of the branch you are pushing)
git push -u origin master

## To push and overwrite (-f --force) differences in remote (for example let's say remote repo was created with a default README.md in github)
git push -u -f origin master

## To push a localBranchName as a different remoteBranchName
git push -u origin localBranchName:remoteBranchName

## To push a tag (like V0.1) to remote
git push -u origin V0.1

## To push all tags to remote
git push --tags

## To delete remote tag
git push origin -d v0.1.1

## To clone a remote repo (preferably a forked remote repo if you dont' own remote repo)
<pre>
git clone urlCopiedFromGitHub
git clone urlCopiedFromGitHub  localDirNameYouWant
</pre>

## To fetch from a remote remoteBranch (NOTE fetch does not update working tree, you need to merge for that)
<pre>
git checkout localBranch
git fetch origin remoteBranch
git branch -a
</pre>

## NOTE just "git fetch" will act on "origin", if you want it to work on another remote, you need to specify it
<pre>
git fetch
git branch -a
git remote add paul https://github.com/csci3444-paul/ex0-git-commands.git
git branch -a
git log paul/master
git fetch paul/master
</pre>

## To fetch from a remote and merge.(NOTE fetch does not update working tree, merge does that)
<pre>
git fetch origin/master
git merge origin/master
</pre>


## To pull (fetch + merge)
git pull origin remoteBranch

## to keep clone of a fork and fork in sync with original repo in github after original changes
if you had forked a repo, lets say, ex4_JS_this_closures_let_arrowFunc, repo of ilker-kiris, then you can resync your local repo to original repo and then push that to your fork in github
+ login to github as you (in this example ilker-public2) and find the original github project (of ilker-kiris), in this example
```
"https://github.com/fdu-csci3444/ex4_JS_this_closures_let_arrowFunc.git"
```
+ then fork it in github site by clicking "fork" button on top right corner
+ copy the git url of your fork, in this example 
```
"https://github.com/fdu-csci3444-public/ex4_JS_this_closures_let_arrowFunc.git"
```
+ in gitbash cd to your project where you are going to clone your fork and then clone it 
```
cd /c/fdu/csci3444/projects
git clone https://github.com/fdu-csci3444-public/ex4_JS_this_closures_let_arrowFunc.git
```
+ see that above fork github repo shows up as "origin" in your remote repos
```
git remote -v
```
+ after some time, let's say original github repo got changed, and you want to sync your local clone of your fork, and your fork in github.
+ 1st add the original github repo url as a remote to your local repo, for example calling it "upstream". Then you should see "upstream" as well as "origin" in your remote repo list
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fdu-csci3444/ex4_JS_this_closures_let_arrowFunc.git
git remote -v
```
+ 2nd fetch the original repo to your local repo;
```
git fetch upstream
```
+ 3rd merge the above fetched repo to your local working view;
```
git merge upstream/master
```
+ 4th push your local repo to your github fork repo
```
git push -u origin master
```
